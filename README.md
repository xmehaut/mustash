Multi-State Sharing Framework

## Getting Started

Mustash (for Multi-State Sharing framework) is a very simple framework and pattern for handling shared states 
between widgets in Flutter. It is far less rich than Mobx, Redux, BLoC and so on... But it is also simpler 
to understand and to implement while doing mainly the job. 

For help getting started with Flutter, view our 
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
